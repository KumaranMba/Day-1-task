2.Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript?
	 objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types,
 in the form of “key: value” pairs. These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties
 and methods, respectively, in the context of an object. 
				Example :-
					var car = {
					     key : value
 					      |      |	
					    Name  : "Toyato"
					   color  : "Green"
					    Model : 2022
					   Mileage: 25
							}(properties)
				console.log(car.model);
